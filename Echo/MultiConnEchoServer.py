    # types.SimpleNamespace is similar to an empty class, except that it has several advantages:
    #   1. it allows you to initialize attributes while constructing the object
    #   2. it provides a readable .repr()
    #   3. it overrides the default comparison. Instead of comparing by .id(), it compares attribute values instead
    # data is the object that holds the data info we want to be included along with the socket
    data = types.SimpleNamespace(addr=address, inb=b"", outb=b"")

    #   for readinig and writing

    # For this sub socket, it would want read events: selectors.EVENT_READ or selectors.EVENT_WRITE
    # data will store what's being sent and received on this sub socket
